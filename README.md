# Granger-Causality, ongoing-project
Machine learning. Granger causality for causal inference
Granger Causality:
a statistical hypothesis test for determining whether one time series is useful in forecasting another
Granger’s point: causality can be tested by measuring the ability to predict the future values of a time series Y using prior values of another time series X
A variable X granger-causes Y :  it means that predictions of the value of Y  based on its own past values and  on the past values of X are better than predictions of Y based only on Y's own past values.
Forecasting: Rather than testing whether X causes Y, the Granger causality tests whether X forecasts Y.
